# PaniniDynamicPages
Allows you to create your own dynamic pages (using Pebble Template Engine) while using PaniniCMS!

Just add PaniniDynamicPages to your plugins folder, create a "custom" folder inside the "frontend" folder and start editing!

If you create a file called "hello", you can access it by using `YourWebsiteURL/hello`!
